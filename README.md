# Google-AIY-voice-kit
Note:
I have created this readme file for reference during the amazon interview the day before.Please apologize if unable to understand :)
Platform: Google AIY kit
Language: Python

Google aiy kit is nothing but a project built on Raspberry pi Zero along with GPU and other devices(mic obviously for voice kit,camera for vision kit)
In this project,We have used the gpio pins in the voice kit to send a on or off signal to the relay(in case of led strip) and controlled the dancing robot directly using the gpio pins.
The voice kit gets command like dance slow,dance fast in case of robot and red,green,blue in case of LED strip.
The pins send signal to trigger a particular servo in case of robot or,particular point in a LED strip to trigger different colours.

I shall update this readme later.Thanks
